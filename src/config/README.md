# CORS Configuration

This is a Node.js code snippet that shows how to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware in a server-side application. The code is written in JavaScript and assumes that you have Node.js and the required packages installed.

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code files.
Install the required dependencies using npm install or your preferred package manager.

## Usage

Import the corsOptions object and the allowedOrigins array into your Node.js application using require.
Use the corsOptions object as a middleware to handle CORS requests for specific routes or all routes in your application.
Here's an example of how to use the corsOptions object in your Node.js application:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const corsOptions = require("./corsOptions");

const app = express();

// Use the `corsOptions` middleware for all routes in the application
app.use(cors(corsOptions));

// Handle GET requests to the `/data` endpoint
app.get("/data", (req, res) => {
  // ...
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000");
});
```

The corsOptions object checks if the origin of the request is allowed based on the values in the allowedOrigins array. If the origin is allowed, the middleware adds the appropriate CORS headers to the response. If the origin is not allowed, the middleware returns a CORS error.

To customize the allowed origins, modify the allowedOrigins array in the allowedOrigins.js file. You can add or remove domains or IP addresses as needed.
